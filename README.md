A one square inch control board for Teacup compatible 3D printers.

This project was created for the Return of the Square Inch Project on Hackaday.io.

Specs:
- ATmega328 microcontroller
- Four STSPIN220 low-voltage stepper motor drivers
- MJD122T4 MOSFET to control extruder temperature
- Power connectors for always-on fans 
- Connector for endstop signals
- Four layer board

To Do:
1. Receive board from OSHPark.
2. Populate.
3. Modify Teacup firmware to work with current setup, change pin definitions.
4. Gut Replikator Mini V1 and hook the new system up with 3D printed case and heatsinks.
5. Create video of print and complete submission for the competition.
